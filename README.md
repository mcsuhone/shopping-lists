# Shopping lists application

This application allows the user to create shopping lists at a web page. New
shopping lists can be added and old ones can be deactivated. Clicking a shopping
list will take the user to the page of that shopping list, displaying all items
in it and also allows the user to add more items to that list. Shopping items
can also be marked as collected, which will put a strikethrough them.

Application is not currently delpoyed to fly.io as the service costs money and needs my credit card info
which I am not willing to give for this project.

You can also test the application locally, by unzipping the file then running
"docker-compose up" at the root directory (same directory where this readme file
is located).
